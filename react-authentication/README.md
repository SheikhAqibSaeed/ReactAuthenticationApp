## Course Description

<p>User authentication is a critical part of virtually every website, yet few web developers know all the details behind how it works and how to use it to provide a good user experience. In this course, instructor Shaun Wassell dives into the details behind user authentication in the context of React and how to incorporate user authentication into React applications. Shaun begins with some definitions, steps, and basic authentication projects. Then he discusses in-depth email verification and how to set it up. Shaun explains how to give users the ability to reset their passwords, then describes the steps in setting up OAuth. He goes over several prebuilt authentication options, then concludes with some best practice recommendations.</p>
<p>This course includes Code Challenges powered by CoderPad. Code Challenges are interactive coding exercises with real-time feedback, so you can get hands-on coding practice alongside the course content to advance your programming skills.</p>

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
